           Hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order.
           This implementation differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through
           all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order). Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set. (An element e is reinserted into a set s if s.add(e)
           is invoked when s.contains(e) would return true immediately prior to the invocation.)
